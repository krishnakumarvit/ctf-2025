🌀 Description:

Welcome to Vibe Code, a challenge where logic meets aesthetic chaos.
In this 4-level progressive puzzle, traditional syntax takes a backseat as contestants navigate through code that speaks the language of vibes — emojis, moods, and patterns that defy conventional programming.

Each level brings you closer to decoding the rhythm of the vibes:

✨ Level 1 — Decode the Function:
Understand a mysterious function powered by emoji variables like ✨🌙🎨.

🌈 Level 2 — Feel the Pattern:
Discover logic hidden in a “feeling array” sorted not by order, but by vibe.

💫 Level 3 — Mood Decryption:
Crack an emotional cipher that changes with every shift in the moodboard.

🔥 Level 4 — The Final Flow:
Combine all your previous insights to reveal the true flag — the essence of the Vibe Code.
